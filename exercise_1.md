# Exercise 1: Simulating Multiple Roles

**Objective: Understand how roles affect the model’s perspective.**

Write a prompt asking the same question (e.g., "What is climate change?").

Add role instructions for at least 3 personas, such as:

Scientist → technical explanation

Journalist → informative for the public

Critic → skeptical tone

Compare how the answers differ.

## My Answers

### First Prompt: Assuming the role of a scientist, what is vagina fistula?

As a scientist (specifically speaking from a medical perspective), a vaginal fistula is an abnormal opening (a pathological connection) between the vagina and another nearby organ that should normally be separate.

***In simple terms:***

It is a hole that forms between the vagina and another organ, causing body fluids to leak uncontrollably through the vagina.

***Scientifically Defined***

A fistula = an abnormal epithelial-lined tract connecting two hollow organs.

When it involves the vagina, it is classified based on which organ is connected to it.

***Common Types of Vaginal Fistulas***

1. Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF)

    - Between the bladder and the vagina
    - Causes continuous leakage of urine through the vagina

2. Rectovaginal fistula (RVF)

    - Between the rectum and the vagina
    - Causes passage of gas or stool through the vagina

3. Ureterovaginal fistula

    - Between the ureter (tube from kidney to bladder) and vagina
    - Leads to urinary leakage

***Causes (Etiology)***

Scientifically, fistulas usually result from:

    - Prolonged obstructed labor (very common cause in low-resource settings)
    - Surgical injury (e.g., hysterectomy complications)
    - Severe infection
    - Trauma
    - Radiation therapy
    - Inflammatory diseases (like Crohn’s disease)

    In parts of sub-Saharan Africa (including Nigeria), prolonged obstructed labor is a major cause due to limited emergency obstetric care.

***Symptoms***

    - Depending on type, symptoms may include:
    - Continuous urine leakage
    - Stool or gas passing through the vagina
    - Foul-smelling discharge
    - Recurrent infections
    - Irritation of surrounding tissue

***Pathophysiology (What Happens Biologically)***

    - During prolonged pressure (for example, obstructed labor), tissue between the vagina and adjacent organ loses blood supply (ischemia).
    - Without oxygen, the tissue dies (necrosis).
    - The dead tissue breaks down → leaving a hole → forming a fistula.

***Treatment***

- Surgical repair (most common and effective)
- Infection control before surgery
- Psychological and social support (important due to stigma)

***Public Health Perspective***

- Vaginal fistula is largely preventable with:
- Timely access to cesarean section
- Skilled birth attendants
- Proper obstetric care

It is considered both a medical condition and a global health equity issue.

### Second Prompt: Assuming the role of a scientist, what is vagina fistula?

A vaginal fistula is a serious medical condition in which an abnormal hole forms between the vagina and another internal organ, most commonly the bladder or the rectum.

In practical terms, it means that urine or stool can leak uncontrollably through the vagina because the tissues that normally separate these organs have been damaged.

***What causes it?***

In many low-resource settings, especially parts of Africa and South Asia, the leading cause is prolonged obstructed labor — when a woman is in labor for many hours or even days without access to emergency medical care. The sustained pressure cuts off blood supply to surrounding tissue, causing it to die and break down, leaving a hole.

In wealthier countries, vaginal fistulas are more often linked to:
- Complications during surgery (such as hysterectomy)
- Cancer treatments like radiation
- Severe infections
- Inflammatory diseases

***What are the effects?***

- Women with a vaginal fistula often experience:
- Continuous leakage of urine
- Passage of stool or gas through the vagina (depending on the type)
- Persistent infections
- Strong odor and skin irritation

Beyond the physical impact, the condition frequently leads to social isolation, stigma, and emotional distress, particularly in communities where awareness is low.

***Can it be treated?***
Yes. Vaginal fistula is usually treatable through surgery, and many repair procedures are highly successful. However, access to trained surgeons and proper medical facilities remains a challenge in some regions.

***Why does it matter?***
Health experts consider vaginal fistula both a medical issue and a human rights concern. It is largely preventable with:

- Skilled birth attendance
- Timely cesarean sections
- Access to emergency obstetric care

Its persistence in some parts of the world highlights gaps in maternal healthcare systems.

### Third Prompt: Assuming the role of a critic, what is vagina fistula?

From a critic’s perspective, a vaginal fistula is more than a medical condition — it is a stark indicator of systemic failure.

Medically, it is an abnormal opening between the vagina and nearby organs such as the bladder or rectum, leading to uncontrollable leakage of urine or stool. But critically examined, its continued existence — especially in low-resource regions — reflects deep inequalities in healthcare access, maternal care, and social support systems.

***A Failure of Systems***

In many parts of the world, vaginal fistula is primarily caused by prolonged obstructed labor without timely medical intervention. That means:

- Lack of access to emergency obstetric care
- Inadequate healthcare infrastructure
- Poverty and rural isolation
- Gender inequality limiting women’s access to medical decisions

In societies with well-functioning maternal health systems, this condition is rare and usually linked to surgical complications rather than childbirth. Its prevalence elsewhere exposes disparities in global health priorities.

***Social Consequences***

Critically, the condition often carries severe stigma. Women affected may be:
- Socially isolated
- Abandoned by partners
- Excluded from community life

Thus, vaginal fistula becomes not only a biological injury but also a social wound — one that reveals how societies treat vulnerable women.

***A Preventable Tragedy***

What makes vaginal fistula especially troubling is that it is largely preventable. Skilled birth attendants, timely cesarean sections, and accessible maternal care dramatically reduce its occurrence. When prevention is possible but not implemented, the issue shifts from purely medical to ethical and political.

From a critic’s lens, vaginal fistula is not just a hole between organs — it is a gap between policy and practice, between rights and reality, and between what is medically achievable and what is socially delivered.

### COmparing how the answers differ

Looking at the lens and emphasis, the scientist explains vaginal fistula in technical, biological terms, focusing on anatomy, causes, and mechanisms. The journalist presents it in a clear, accessible way for the public, highlighting real-world impact and human stories. The critic goes beyond description to examine what the condition reveals about healthcare inequality and social systems. So, while all three define the same condition, they differ in purpose: one informs scientifically, one informs socially, and one evaluates systemically.
