# role-prompts

## Overview

Simulating personas: expert, assistant, critic, etc.

Injecting tone and perspective into model responses

---
## Learning Objectives
Write prompts that change tone (friendly vs professional)

Create expert personas for tasks (e.g., lawyer, recruiter, tutor)

Compare how role instructions influence outputs

***Exercises of the quest***

**Note:** All submitted answers will be scanned using an AI Detector. If your response is identified as being generated by an AI tool (ChatGPT, etc.), it will be rejected. Make sure to write answers in your own words and avoid copying AI-generated text.

**Exercise 0**: Environment and Libraries

**Exercise 1**: Simulating multiple roles

**Exercise 2**: Role-based mentoring and feedback

**Exercise 3**: Tone variation with the same task

## Virtual Environment
OpenAI Playground or ChatGPT interface

Python 3.9+ installed locally (optional, for simulating API workflows)

---

#### Exercise 0: Environment and libraries
**Objective:** Set up the environment for Python development.

Install Python (latest stable version, preferably 3.9+).

Verify installation by running:

python --version
Write and execute a Hello, World! program.

---

#### Exercise 1: Simulating Multiple Roles
**Objective:** Understand how roles affect the model’s perspective.

Write a prompt asking the same question (e.g., "What is climate change?").

Add role instructions for at least 3 personas, such as:

Scientist → technical explanation

Journalist → informative for the public

Critic → skeptical tone

Compare how the answers differ.

---

#### Exercise 2: Role-Based Mentoring and Feedback
**Objective:** Use role-based prompts for personalized feedback.

Ask the model to act as a coding mentor.

Provide a simple piece of code (e.g., a Python function with a bug).

Prompt the model: "Act as a mentor reviewing this code. Provide corrections and explain improvements."

Review the response and check if the role influences feedback style.

---

#### Exercise 3: Tone Variation with the Same Task
**Objective:** Control tone and style with explicit instructions.

Choose one task (e.g., "Write an email inviting a candidate to an interview").

Write two prompts:

One for a **friendly tone**

One for a **professional tone**

Compare the outputs and note how the tone changes while the content stays consistent.

---

### Submission
Provide all exercises. For each exercise include the prompts, model outputs, and a brief sentence analysis explaining how tone, persona, or role instructions influence content, style, or reasoning. Ensure each role or tone produces clearly distinct outputs, and differences are documented.
